# Ongoing Supervision Program (FLT)

Everything you need to perform ongoing supervision of pressurised vessels in one place.

---

## What Is This?

This folder contains the complete documentation package for performing **Ongoing Supervision** (Fortlöpande Tillsyn / FLT) of pressurised vessels under AFS 2017:3. Print these documents, take them to a site, and you have everything needed to build and run a supervision program.

## The 6 Mandatory Checks (AFS 2017:3, 2 Kap. §6)

Every supervision program must address at minimum:

1. Equipment **functions satisfactorily**
2. **No leaks** have occurred
3. Equipment not subjected to **harmful external or internal impact**
4. **No other faults or deviations** have occurred
5. Equipment, valves, emergency stops are **correctly marked**
6. **Prescribed inspections** have been carried out

These six points are the legal baseline. The supervision program template (TMP-LOG-005) builds on these with additional checks for safety devices, lifetime tracking, and site-specific risks.

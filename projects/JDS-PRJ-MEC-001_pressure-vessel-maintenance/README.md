## What Is This?

A complete, reusable service for managing **ongoing maintenance and inspection of pressurised vessels**. Built on Swedish regulations (AFS 2017:3) as the foundation, designed to be adapted to any country's requirements.

This is a service you can offer to clients: *"I will set up and manage your pressure vessel maintenance program, ensuring regulatory compliance and full documentation traceability."*

The JDS system drives the entire workflow — every inventory, inspection plan, supervision round, and inspection report is a JDS document with full traceability.

## The Maintenance Cycle

```
SET UP → INVENTORY → CLASSIFY → PLAN → INSPECT → REPORT → UPDATE → REPEAT
  │         │           │         │        │         │         │
  │     TMP-LOG-002  Reg.Ref   TMP-LOG-004  Accredited  TMP-RPT-003  Equipment
  │     (inventory)            (plan)        Inspector   (report)     Register
  │                                                                   Update
  └── JDS-PRO-010 (master procedure) governs every step
```

## How to Run a Maintenance Program

Follow **JDS-PRO-010** (Ongoing Maintenance Program Procedure) for the complete workflow. Quick reference:

| Step | What to Do | JDS Template |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1. Create client folder | Set up `03-active-programs/[client]/` | — |
| 2. Build equipment register | Walk the site, record every vessel | JDS-TMP-LOG-002 |
| 3. Classify vessels | Determine risk class A/B, PED category | Regulatory reference |
| 4. Build inspection plan | Schedule all inspections for the year | JDS-TMP-LOG-004 |
| 5. Perform supervision | Regular supervision walk-arounds | JDS-TMP-LOG-003 |
| 6. Perform inspections | Accredited inspector (Class A) or own (Class B) | JDS-TMP-RPT-003 |
| 7. Report and update | Document findings, update register | JDS-PRO-008 |

## How to Expand to a New Country

1. Create a new folder under `02-regulations/` (e.g., `NO-norway/`)
2. Document that country's pressure vessel regulations
3. Create a traceability matrix mapping JDS procedures to those regulations
4. The templates and procedures still apply — only the regulatory reference changes

**You never touch the Swedish files to add another country.**

## What Is This?

A fully local image generation and photo editing app, with optional cloud backends for higher quality. Runs on Apple Silicon via Stable Diffusion. No filters, no restrictions.

Double-click to launch. Close to quit. Nothing stays running.

## Modes

| Mode | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| **txt2img** | Generate images from text prompts (local or cloud) |
| **img2img** | Transform photos with a prompt + strength (local or cloud) |
| **inpaint** | Paint a mask, regenerate just that area (change outfits, remove items) |
| **edit** | Smart masks, inpaint presets, ControlNet, background, lighting, face swap |

## Key Features

- **Smart masking** — auto-detect clothing, skin, body, face regions for targeted editing
- **Inpaint presets** — one-click workflows: remove clothing, change outfit, swimwear, lingerie, artistic nude, enhance body, gravure swimwear/lingerie/portrait
- **ControlNet** — preserve pose/structure while regenerating (openpose, canny edge, depth)
- **Auto Mask + Inpaint** — one-click: detect clothing, apply preset prompt, inpaint
- **Inpainting** — brush over socks, clothes, objects to remove or replace them
- **Background removal** — one click, subject detected automatically (rembg)
- **Background replacement** — describe new background, AI generates it around the subject
- **Lighting effects** — simulate sun, lamp, any direction with warmth control
- **Neural face swap** — ReActor-grade INSwapper model, auto-downloads, Poisson fallback
- **Multi-face swap** — swap all faces in a group photo, similarity-ranked (FaceSwapLab)
- **Diffusion refinement** — optional SD inpaint pass over swapped face to fix artifacts (DiffFace)
- **Face switch** — swap faces between two photos (A's face on B, B's face on A), both results saved
- **Pose quality check** — warns if face is at extreme angle before swapping, proceeds anyway
- **Face checkpoints** — save/reuse faces across sessions (FaceSwapLab concept)
- **Cloud generation** — HuggingFace (free) / AI Horde (free) / Prodia (free key) / Replicate (free tier) for SDXL, Flux, NSFW-capable models
- **Cloud video** — image-to-video via HuggingFace SVD (free) or Replicate (free tier), generates 25-frame .mp4 from any image
- **Qwen AI Edit** — direct neural image editing: type "remove her clothes" or "change to bikini" and Qwen-Image-Edit (Rapid-AIO NSFW v23) edits the image directly. Cloud (free via HuggingFace) or local (GGUF Q4 for M1). Vision analysis, edit suggestions, prompt engineering.
- **Avatar Creator** — full character builder: ethnicity, age, face shape, skin tone, eye shape/colour, hair style/colour, makeup, lips, expression, breast size, butt size, body type, height/weight, pose, outfit, setting — builds optimized prompt from selections
- **Prompt Enhance** — one-click quality anchors (photorealistic/Asian realism/gravure/K-beauty/portrait/cinematic), lighting presets, lens simulation (photorealistic/gravure/portrait/cinematic), lighting presets (studio/golden hour/Rembrandt/ring light), lens simulation (85mm/50mm/135mm bokeh)
- **Gravure presets** — optimized prompts for Japanese glamour photography (swimwear, lingerie, portrait)
- **Unrestricted** — no safety filters, no content restrictions, your machine your rules
- **5 curated models** — Realistic Vision v5.1 (default), Deliberate v2, Dreamlike, SD 1.5, SD 2.1
- **Model Manager** — download any HuggingFace model from inside the app
- **Photo negative preset** — one click anti-artifact prompt for clean realistic photos
- **DPM++ 2M Karras** — fast, high-quality sampling
- **Clean shutdown** — close window, model unloaded, memory freed

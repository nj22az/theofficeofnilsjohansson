## [2.6] — 2026-03-25

### Changed
- **Root README.md** rewritten — repo is now THE JDS, not "a repo with JDS in a subfolder"

- Root README serves as the definitive landing page: find-what-you-need table, full structure, categories, domains, quick start guide
- All wide tables split to ≤7 columns for A4 readability (TMP-LOG-001, LOG-MEC-002, LOG-MEC-003, RPT-MEC-002)
- **jds-validate.py** — added table column width check (max 7), fixed naming pattern for examples/

## [2.4] — 2026-03-25

### Changed
- **JDS-PRO-007** Information Design Standard updated to Rev B — expanded from 8 to 14 sections
- **md2pdf.py** stylesheet upgraded to world-class level with design tokens, baseline grid, and accessibility compliance

### Added (PRO-007 New Sections)
- **§9 Grid System & Vertical Rhythm** — 6pt baseline unit, horizontal grid rules, content density (Toyota A3-inspired)
- **§10 Page Architecture** — five-zone page model with header/footer separator lines, first-page title block, continuation page rules
- **§11 Micro-Typography** — letter-spacing table, font weight discipline, WCAG 2.1 Level AA contrast ratios
- **§12 Figure & Table Conventions** — sequential numbering, revision history distinct styling
- **§13 Emptiness & Receptivity (Ku)** — Kenya Hara/MUJI philosophy codified: white space as active structure

### Stylesheet Improvements (md2pdf.py)
- Header/footer separator lines (0.25pt rules framing content zone)
- H1 increased to 20pt with 2pt bottom rule for authority
- All spacing aligned to 6pt baseline grid (24pt above H2, 18pt above H3, 12pt above H4)
- Improved table cell padding (6pt/8pt headers, 5pt/8pt cells)
- Revision history table gets distinct compact styling via HTML post-processing
- Blockquotes no longer force italic (better readability for long passages)
- Design token documentation in CSS comments
- Complete CSS comment structure referencing PRO-007 section numbers

### Design Research
- Analysed corporate document design from: Apple (San Francisco, optical hierarchy), Toyota (A3 one-page thinking), Bauhaus (grid systems, form follows function), Kenya Hara/MUJI (emptiness over minimalism), Bosch (WCAG accessibility, Red Dot Award design system), DNV (classification document architecture), Instron (engineering quality manual format)
- Synthesised 15 world-class design principles into JDS standards

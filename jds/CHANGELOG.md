# JDS System Changelog

All changes to the JDS documentation system itself are recorded here. This provides a single place to see how the system has evolved over time.

---

## [3.3] — 2026-04-11

### Changed — Project Restructure & Consolidation
- **JDS-PRJ-MEC-002 merged into JDS-PRJ-MEC-001** — the Vessel Supervision System is now a subfolder (`03-supervision/`) inside the Pressure Vessel Ongoing Maintenance Program. One project, one folder, one changelog.
- **Project folder naming simplified** — folders now use JDS codes only (`JDS-PRJ-MEC-001/`) without descriptive suffixes. CLAUDE.md updated accordingly.
- **Templates centralised** — JDS-TMP-LOG-005 through 009 moved from project folder to `jds/templates/logs/` alongside all other system templates.
- **Older templates superseded** — JDS-TMP-LOG-001 (replaced by TMP-LOG-008), JDS-TMP-LOG-002 (replaced by TMP-LOG-008), JDS-TMP-LOG-003 (replaced by TMP-LOG-006). All marked SUPERSEDED with pointers to replacements.
- **AFS PDFs consolidated** — duplicate regulatory PDFs removed from `projects/` root; single copies now in `JDS-PRJ-MEC-001/02-regulations/SE-sweden/`.
- **JDS-PRO-010 updated** — template references changed from superseded TMP-LOG-001/002/003 to current TMP-LOG-005/006/008. Supervision workflow now includes program creation, round records, and annual reviews.
- **Document register updated** — all paths corrected for new folder structure. JDS-PRJ-MEC-002 marked SUPERSEDED. TMP-LOG-001/002/003 marked SUPERSEDED.

### Added
- **`projects/index.md`** — project index listing all JDS projects by document number with status.

## [3.2] — 2026-04-10

### Added — Vessel Supervision System (JDS-PRJ-MEC-002)
- **JDS-PRJ-MEC-002**: Vessel Supervision System — complete project for creating, managing, and performing ongoing supervision programs for pressurised vessels. Built on AFS 2017:3 consolidated with all amendments (AFS 2019:1, AFS 2020:10, AFS 2022:2).
- **JDS-MAN-MEC-002**: Supervision Program Manual — full methodology for building and running supervision programs: site survey, risk assessment, check design, documentation, annual review.
- **JDS-LOG-MEC-005**: Supervision Program Register — master tracker for all active supervision programs.
- **JDS-RPT-MEC-003**: AFS 2017:3 Consolidated Supervision Requirements — English-language summary of the base regulation and all three amendments, focused on ongoing supervision requirements.

### Added — Vessel Classification Script & Document Chain
- **`scripts/jds-classify.py`**: Automatic vessel classification per AFS 2017:3 (consolidated). Six modes: interactive, quick, CSV batch, `--program` (from inventory), `--round` (from program), `--review` (from program). Each document is self-contained and links to the next step in the chain: INVENTORY → PROGRAM → ROUND → REVIEW.
- **CLAUDE.md** updated with all jds-classify.py modes in automation tools table.

## [3.1] — 2026-03-25

### Changed — Repository Restructure for Authority
- **Root reduced to 4 folders**: `jds/` (system), `projects/` (work), `scripts/` (tools), `personal/` (non-JDS). Down from 12 top-level folders.
- **`blog/` moved to `projects/blog/`** — JDS owns the repo structure; Jekyll adapts. GitHub Actions workflow updated.
- **`3d-modeling/` moved to `projects/3d-modeling/`** — all work output under one roof.
- **`collections/`, `documents/`, `archive/` moved to `personal/`** — non-JDS content consolidated.
- **Root README.md** rewritten as JDS authority page — action-oriented "I need to..." task table replaces folder tour.

- **CLAUDE.md §Structure** now defines the 4-folder root formally.

### Added — Office Document PDF Converter
- **`scripts/office2pdf.py`**: Reads JDS Excel workbooks (timesheet, expense, mileage) and renders as proper JDS-PRO-007 compliant PDFs using weasyprint. Same design language as `md2pdf.py` — logo header band, metadata card, navy headings, alternating rows, computed totals, running header/footer.

---

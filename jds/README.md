## What is JDS?

JDS is the in-house documentation and quality management system for all engineering work produced under The Office of Nils Johansson. It defines how documents are created, numbered, reviewed, revised, stored, and retired.

Every document — whether it's a field service report, a 3D model drawing, a timesheet, or a technical manual — follows the same system. This ensures consistency, traceability, and professionalism across all work.

## Document Number Format

Technical documents carry an engineering domain code so you can identify the discipline at a glance:

```
JDS-[CATEGORY]-[DOMAIN]-[NUMBER]
Example: JDS-DWG-MEC-003     (3rd mechanical drawing)
Example: JDS-RPT-MAR-001     (1st marine report)
```

System documents (procedures, templates, quality) omit the domain:

```
JDS-[CATEGORY]-[NUMBER]
Example: JDS-PRO-003
```

With revision: `JDS-DWG-MEC-003 Rev B`

## Engineering Domain Codes

| Code | Domain | Typical Work |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **MEC** | Mechanical | Pumps, valves, flanges, brackets |
| **MAR** | Marine | Ship systems, engine room equipment |
| **AUT** | Automation & Controls | PLC, HMI, sensors, wiring |
| **ELE** | Electrical | Power, motors, generators |
| **PIP** | Piping | Pipe systems, fittings, P&IDs |
| **STR** | Structural | Frames, mounts, enclosures |
| **TST** | Testing & Measurement | Test fixtures, calibration tools |
| **FAB** | Fabrication & Prototyping | 3D printed parts, CNC, workshop |
| **THR** | Thermal & HVAC | Heat exchangers, cooling, ventilation |
| **SFW** | Software | Scripts, tools, applications |
| **GEN** | General | Cross-discipline |

## Core Principles

1. **Every document gets a number.** No exceptions. Even drafts get a number with "DRAFT" status.
2. **Revisions are tracked.** Every change is recorded with who, when, and why.
3. **One source of truth.** The version in this repository is the current version. Period.
4. **Keep it simple.** The system serves the work, not the other way around. If a form feels unnecessary, question it.
5. **Write for the next person.** Every document should be understandable by someone who wasn't there when it was written.

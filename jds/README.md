## What is JDS?

JDS is a complete documentation and quality management system. It defines how documents are created, numbered, reviewed, revised, stored, and retired. Every document — whether it's a field report, a 3D model, a timesheet, or a technical manual — follows the same system.

JDS is designed to be:
- **Reusable** — any organisation can adopt or adapt it
- **Offline-first** — everything lives in the repository; no cloud services required
- **Self-improving** — the system enforces its own maintenance through automated validation and mandatory review cycles
- **Plain-language** — readable by anyone, regardless of technical background

## Why This System Exists

Documentation is often treated as an afterthought. JDS treats it as engineering. When documentation is inconsistent, incomplete, or hard to find, work gets repeated, mistakes recur, and knowledge is lost. JDS prevents this by defining clear rules for every document type and enforcing them automatically.

The goal is simple: **any document can be found in under 60 seconds, and understood by someone who wasn't there when it was written.**

## Document Number Format

**Technical documents** include a domain code identifying the engineering discipline:

```
JDS-[CATEGORY]-[DOMAIN]-[NUMBER]
Example: JDS-DWG-MEC-003     → 3rd mechanical drawing
Example: JDS-RPT-ELE-001     → 1st electrical report
```

**System documents** (procedures, templates, quality) omit the domain:

```
JDS-[CATEGORY]-[NUMBER]
Example: JDS-PRO-003          → 3rd procedure
```

With revision: `JDS-DWG-MEC-003 Rev B`

## Domain Codes

| Code | Domain | Typical Work |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **MEC** | Mechanical | Pumps, valves, flanges, brackets |
| **MAR** | Marine | Ship systems, vessel equipment |
| **AUT** | Automation & Controls | PLC, HMI, sensors, wiring |
| **ELE** | Electrical | Power, motors, generators |
| **PIP** | Piping | Pipe systems, fittings, flow diagrams |
| **STR** | Structural | Frames, mounts, enclosures |
| **TST** | Testing & Measurement | Test fixtures, calibration tools |
| **FAB** | Fabrication & Prototyping | 3D printed parts, CNC, workshop |
| **THR** | Thermal & HVAC | Heat exchangers, cooling, ventilation |
| **SFW** | Software | Scripts, tools, applications |
| **GEN** | General | Cross-discipline or general-purpose |

## Core Principles

1. **Every document gets a number.** No exceptions. Even drafts get a number with "DRAFT" status.
2. **Revisions are tracked.** Every change is recorded with who, when, and why.
3. **One source of truth.** The Git repository main branch is the current version. Everything else is an uncontrolled copy.
4. **Write for the next person.** Every document must be understandable by someone who wasn't there when it was written — and who may not share your technical background.
5. **The system improves itself.** Every work session leaves JDS at least as good as it was found. The validator enforces this automatically.
6. **Offline-first.** Everything needed to use this system lives in the repository. No internet required for daily use.

## Using JDS Offline

JDS is designed to work without an internet connection. Clone the repository, and you have the complete system:

- All procedures and templates in `jds/`
- All automation tools in `scripts/`
- Run `python3 scripts/jds-validate.py` to check system health
- Run `python3 scripts/md2pdf.py <file.md>` to generate PDFs
- Commit and push when connectivity is restored

See [Quality Manual §22](quality-manual/JDS-QMS-000_quality-manual.md) for the full offline resilience policy.

|---|---|
| **Document No.** | JDS-RPT-MEC-004 |
| **Revision** | A |
| **Date** | 2026-03-26 |
| **Status** | EXAMPLE |

| **Severity** | Major |

## 1. Deviation Summary

| | |
|---|---|
| **What deviated** | Wall thickness of pressure vessel PV-003 below expected value at support saddle location |
| **Where** | Compressed air receiver PV-003, Compressor room Bay 3, SPI Industrivägen facility |
| **When discovered** | 15 April 2026, during annual inspection |
| **Discovered by** | N. Johansson, Lead Inspector |
| **Requirement** | Minimum wall thickness 6.2mm per design calculation (EN 13445-3). Previous reading 7.1mm (April 2025). |
| **Actual** | Measured wall thickness 6.8mm — loss of 0.3mm in 12 months (accelerated from historical rate of 0.15mm/year) |

---

## 2. Severity Classification

| Level | Criteria | This Deviation |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| **Critical** | Safety risk, regulatory non-compliance, or major quality failure | [ ] |
| **Major** | Significant departure from specification, affects fitness for purpose | [x] |
| **Minor** | Cosmetic, administrative, or does not affect function or safety | [ ] |

**Justification:** The vessel remains above the minimum design thickness (6.8mm > 6.2mm), so there is no immediate safety risk. However, the corrosion rate has doubled compared to historical data. At the current accelerated rate, the vessel will reach minimum thickness in approximately 2 years. This requires a change to the inspection interval and a root cause investigation into why corrosion has accelerated.

## 4. Root Cause Analysis

**The 5 Whys:**

1. **Why** is the wall thinner than expected? Localised corrosion at the support saddle area.
2. **Why** is corrosion concentrated at the support saddle? Moisture collects between the vessel shell and the saddle, creating a crevice corrosion environment.
3. **Why** is moisture present? The saddle design does not allow drainage, and the insulation was removed during a 2024 modification, exposing the area to condensation.
4. **Why** was the insulation removed? During a compressor replacement in 2024, insulation was removed for crane access and not reinstated.
5. **Why** was reinstatement not tracked? No work completion checklist was used for the compressor replacement project.

**Root cause:** Insulation removed during adjacent equipment modification was not reinstated, exposing the vessel-to-saddle interface to condensation and accelerating crevice corrosion.

## 5. Impact Assessment

### 5.1 Direct Impact

| Area | Impact | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Safety | Low | Vessel remains above minimum design thickness. No immediate risk. |
| Quality | Medium | Accelerated degradation reduces remaining service life. |
| Schedule | Medium | Inspection interval shortened to 6 months. Additional inspections required. |
| Cost | Low | Insulation reinstatement is straightforward. No vessel repair needed yet. |

### 5.2 Horizontal Deployment

| Area Checked | Same Risk? | Action Needed |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| PV-001, PV-002, PV-004 (same room) | No | Insulation intact on all three vessels. Confirmed during inspection. |
| Other site vessels (boiler room) | Possible | Request client to verify insulation status on all pressure vessels. |

## 6. Corrective Action

| Action | Responsible | Due Date | Status |
|--------|------------|----------|--------|
| Reinstate insulation at PV-003 support saddle area | SPI Maintenance (T. Eriksson) | 2026-05-15 | Open |
| Apply corrosion-resistant coating to exposed saddle area before insulating | SPI Maintenance | 2026-05-15 | Open |
| Create work completion checklist for all future modification projects | SPI Quality (M. Berg) | 2026-06-01 | Open |
| Verify insulation status on all site pressure vessels | SPI Maintenance | 2026-05-01 | Open |
| Re-inspect PV-003 in 6 months (October 2026) | N. Johansson | 2026-10-15 | Open |

## 7. Disposition

- [ ] **Use as-is** — deviation accepted, no rework needed (justification required)
- [ ] **Rework** — item will be corrected to meet the original requirement
- [x] **Repair** — item will be brought to an acceptable condition (may differ from original spec)
- [ ] **Reject / Scrap** — item cannot be used and will be disposed of
- [ ] **Concession** — client/authority accepts the deviation with conditions

**Justification:** The vessel is safe to continue operating (6.8mm > 6.2mm minimum). The repair is to reinstate the insulation and apply protective coating to halt further accelerated corrosion. The shortened inspection interval provides monitoring until the repair is confirmed effective.
